Hashnode enables you to customize the navigation bar of your blog to fit your needs. You can pin your [Series](series.md), [Static Pages](static-pages.md), [Customized URLs](custom-page-rules.md) or external links to your navbar.

You can utilize this feature in so many exciting ways. For instance, you can add a link to your **Youtube channel** on your blog's navbar to create more awareness for it or even create and add an **About page** to the navbar to give your readers or potential employers a sense of who you are.

Here's how to pin items on the navbar of your Hashnode blog. 👇

1. Go to your **blog's dashboard** and click on the **Navbar** tab.

2. Click on the **Add an Item** button and enter a **Label** for the Navbar. 

3. Select the item you want to add to the navbar of your blog. Example: a series, page, customized URL, or an external link. 

4. Add a **Value** for the navbar item and assign it a **Priority** to control the order in which it will be rendered.
