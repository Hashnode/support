9. Once the articles are imported, you can either **save them as drafts** or **publish them directly**. The image below shows an example of importing an article as a draft.

If you import the articles as drafts, you can find them in your draft list. You can access your draft articles [here](https://hashnode.com/drafts).

If you publish the articles directly, you can see them on your blog.

## Bulk Markdown Importer

With the new bulk markdown importer, you can import a zip file containing posts in markdown format. Follow the steps below to use this feature.

1. Go to your blog's dashboard, navigate to the **IMPORT** tab, and click on Bulk Markdown Importer.

![Import Tab](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616574938413/Rjzr672Zq.png?auto=compress)

> Your zip file should contain a `.md` file for each post. The importer will read the markdown frontmatter (title, slug, date, and image) of your `.md` file and use it for your blog post.

3. Finally, click on the **Publish** button to publish the markdown file(s) to your blog.

## RSS Importer

In addition to our Medium, Dev.to, and Bulk markdown importer, you can also import articles to your Hashnode blog using our RSS importer. 

The RSS importer is the most recommended method to use when migrating articles from WordPress to Hashnode. 😀

To use the new RSS Importer, go to your blog's dashboard, navigate to Import and click on RSS Importer. In the *Import from RSS* section, enter your RSS feed URL & the tag containing the post body into the input fields. Then, click on Import.
