## How to migrate an old series

Previously, **Series** could only be created on Hashnode's domain `hashnode.com/series` instead of your blog's domain `edidiongasikpo.com/series`. 

Now that you can create **Series** directly on your blog, here's all you need to know about migrating. 👇

1. If you have just one blog on Hashnode, and some series where the posts are a part of your blog, we've done the migration for you. You can visit your blog's dashboard and click on Series to find those series.

2. If you have just one blog on Hashnode, but your series consists of posts that are published on `hashnode.com` URL, you have to follow the steps to migrate it to your blog: 

    -   Go to [hashnode.com/my-series](https://hashnode.com/my-series) to find all your existing series that have not been migrated
    -   Choose a specific series
    -   Make sure all the posts from that series are a part of your blog. If not, manually edit and move them to your blog
    -   Now, click on the **Edit** button on the series, and move it to your blog.

    -   Finally, edit the posts again and tag them with the correct series!

3. If you have multiple blogs on Hashnode, you have to edit your existing series and move them to the right blog. Just make sure all the posts in your series are a part of the destination blog.
