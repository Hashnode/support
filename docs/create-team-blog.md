title: Create Team Blog (Beta)
---

:::caution Remember
The Team Blog feature is currently **in beta** (ongoing testing/improvements), and is not available publicly to all Hashnode users, and will become a **paid feature** soon.

::: 



However, if you think you need this feature to run an **active** team blog and you will be open to **give feedback**, please write to us at support@hashnode.com to request to join the beta access list.

**Writing to us at support@hashnode.com for getting into the beta access list doesn’t fully guarantee access to the team publication. This feature will be available in GA by early 2022** 

Remember, your _Team Blog_ is still a "blog"; all the features and settings of a _Personal Blog_ still apply. Hence, you can customize your _Team Blog_ as you deem fit using the guides provided [here](account-settings.md).
