The Custom Page Rules feature on Hashnode enables you to create customized URLs linked to your blog’s domain. For example, you can create a custom URL like this `your blog’s domain/youtube` for your Youtube channel. 

## Why is this feature helpful?

There are a ton of networking and social platforms in the world. Most times, it's always hard for our mutuals to find us on those platforms because they can’t remember our username. 

If you link up your active networking or social platforms to your Hashnode blog’s domain, it will be easier for people to find you on those platforms. For instance, if your mutual is trying to remember the name of your YouTube channel, they can quickly go to `your blog’s domain/youtube` instead of thinking for minutes or googling. 

In addition to that, you can also add these customized URLs to your blog's navigation bar to create more awareness about your Youtube channel. 😀

## How to use the custom page rules feature 

Follow the steps below to create customized URLs using Hashnode’s Custom Page Rules feature:

1. Go to your blog’s dashboard and click on the **Advanced** tab.

2. Scroll down to the custom page section and add a **name** for the customized URL you want to create. 

3. Select your preferred **redirect type** - a 301 redirect means that the page has permanently moved to a new location, while a 302 redirect means that the move is only temporary.

4. Add the **destination URL**.

5. Finally, click on the **Add rule** button to complete the process. 

If you type in `your blog's domain/youtube` (in my case `edidiongasikpo.com/youtube`) on your browser now, you will be redirected to your youtube channel. 🥳
