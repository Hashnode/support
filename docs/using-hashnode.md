Hashnode is a free developer blogging platform that allows you to publish articles on your domain and helps you stay connected with a global developer community.

With Hashnode, you can create a [personal blog](create-personal-blog) or [team blog](create-team-blog) on your domain for free without sacrificing visibility, reach, and total independence of your content and canonical.

## How Hashnode Works

When you write articles on your personal or team blog, Hashnode displays them on feeds using an intelligent algorithm. This allows readers interested in your content to find you, follow you, subscribe to your newsletter, get notified when you publish new content, and continuously read your articles.

We also feature top articles on the **🔥Best** section at the top of our feeds page, social media platforms, and weekly newsletter. Your only focus should be writing; Hashnode is here to put you in the spotlight, help you grow and reach your desired audience.

## Create an Account

To get started with Hashnode, you need to create a free account using any of our multiple authentication options. With your Hashnode account, you can [create a personal blog](create-personal-blog), [create multiple team blogs](create-team-blog),  [publish your own articles](write-an-article), [interact with the community](#read-articles), follow your favourite blogs, bookmark articles, [join writing challenges](#join-the-2articles1week-challenge) and much more.

[Sign in and Create an account](#create-an-account) using our passwordless authentication process with your email address or social accounts.

## Write Articles

You can [write and publish](write-an-article) articles using our powerful markdown editor and get your content distributed to all Hashnode users who follow tags related to your article, your followers, and the general public. If you enable the [newsletter](newsletter) feature, your subscribers will get notified immediately you publish a new article.

## Read Articles

You can read articles from thousands of writers from diverse regions, and interact with them by [reacting on their article](hashnode-glossary#reaction), giving feedback by commenting and sharing their article.

Don't forget to [follow your preferred tags](https://hashnode.com/tags) to ensure that our feeds algorithm recommends articles that match your interest.

## Writing Challenges

As developers, we write to share knowledge, document our learnings, and improve our skills. This challenge aims to encourage writers to define their writing goals, understand writing standards, become consistent at writing, and build their careers.
