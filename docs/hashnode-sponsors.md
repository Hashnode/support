Hashnode Sponsors is a non-intrusive inbuilt 1:1 micropayment service that enables you to earn money from blogging without adding ads, pop-ups, or paywalls to your blog. 

When someone sponsors your article via Hashnode Sponsors, you will receive the money instantly to your bank account without Hashnode taking any single commission from it. We acknowledge that you put in all the work to create the article, so you should take all the money! 😃 

Hashnode Sponsors is currently available in over [40 countries](https://hashnode.com/sponsors) across the world. But, we plan to make it accessible to more countries soon.
